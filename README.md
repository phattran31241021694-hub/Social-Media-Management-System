# DSA-Project-Social-Management-System
This is the Algorithm and Data Structure project by our team, carried out by four members from the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH). This project focuses on managing and processing post data using a Single Linked List data structure, including functions such as adding, deleting, searching, sorting, and statistical analysis within a WinForms application
